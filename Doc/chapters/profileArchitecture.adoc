= Proposition of a better profile architecture 

Be careful, this is not a picture of how profiles are currently implemented. We wanted to porpose here a suggestion of how better a profile architecture could be in J-Voting.

Go to link:chapters/profileInterfaces.adoc[The notion of Profile] if you want to learn more about what is an complete / Incomplete profile.

== Notion of mutability 

In the theory of social choice, a Profile (groupement of voters with their preference) can be mutable in two different ways : 

- The population is fixed but the preferences aren't.
In other words, preferences are modifiable which means that the  alternatives can be reordered, removed or new ones can be added. Nevertheless the voters always stay the same. 

- The preferences are fixed but the population isn't.
In other words, here we can add new voters, or remove an existing one. However once a preference is made it can not be changed.

We decided to build this new architecture proposition around the first definition. Indeed, we can say that if the population needs to be somehow changed. Then, we can create a new profile duplicating the preferences but with other voters. 


=== Ok, but why a MutableLinearProfile does not extend a MutableGeneralProfile ? 

Because a MutableLinearProfile manipulates MutableLinearPreferences and a MutableGeneralProfile manipulates MutablePreferences. 

Futhermore, a MutableLinearPreferences is not a more precise version of a MutablePreferences. Those two type of prefences have no relation link between them. The contrary would break their contract. 

Here is the reason why, when a preference is mutable it can be openly modified. Whereas if the preference is mutable and linear, each modification must maintain the linearity. 



=== We can wonder, why don't we have the same issue regarding the Immutable Profiles ?

An Immutable Linear profile can extend an Immutable Complete profile without breaking its contract because the Linear Preferences manipulated are actually a more precise version of Complete Preferences. Indeed, because those two types of preferences are Immutable then we can deduce the Complete preference out of a Linear one. 

Hint : Think about a person having a strict fixed opinion about something. Well, it is actually possible to deduce his opinon by asking him question using only ">=" or "<=" on the way he ranks alternatives. 


=== Precision on the Profile Set of Alternatives

Inside a profile the set of alternatives is common to all the voters. It is actually the union of all the alternatives present in every preferences.


== Methods Contracts

=== *GeneralProfile*

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Hint

| getPreference(Voter v)
| Return the preference of a given Voter v not null. 
|

| getProfile()
| Return the profile as a map mapping the voters to their preference.
|

|getAllVoters(int i)
| Return a sorted set of all the voters in the profile. The voters are ordered by id.
| If you want the profile total number of voters you can just take the size of this list.

|getNbVoterForPreference(Preference p)
| Return the number of voters that voted for a provided Preference not null.
|

|getDuplicates(Preference p)
| Return a set of all the duplicates preferences in the profiles.
| If a preference has at least an equivalent in the general profile set then it is added in the set returned by this function. 
If you want to retrieve the number of unique preferences you can just substract the main set with this set of duplicates.

|getAlternatives()
| Return a set of all the alternatives in the profile.
| If you want the total number of alternatives, take the size of this list. 

|===


=== *MutableLinearProfile*

[cols="1,1", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract


| getPreference(Voter v)
| Return the MutableLinearPreference of a given Voter v not null. 


| addAlternative(Alternative a)
|  Adds the specified alternative at the last rank of every preferences in the profile if it is not already present.


|removeAlternative(Alternative a)
| Removes the specified alternative from every preferences in the profile if it is present.

|===

=== *MutableGeneralProfile*

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Hint

| getPreference(Voter v)
| Return the MutablePreference of a given Voter v not null. 
|

| getMaxSizeOfPreference()
| Return the maximum size of a Preference.
|

| addAlternative(Alternative a)
| Adds an alternative to every preferences in the profile. This alternative is not preferred to any other in each preference, it is being added isolated.
| 

|removeAlternative(Alternative a)
| Removes the specified alternative from every preferences in the profile if it is present.
| A voir !!

=== *MutableCompleteGeneralProfile*

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"] 
|===
|Method name
|Contract
|Hint


| getPreference(Voter v)
| Return the MutableCompletePreference of a given Voter v not null. 
| Be careful, this type of preference does not exit yet in project.
